          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            FarmCo App was born from a simple observation: local farmers were struggling to reach customers, 
            while consumers were looking for fresh, local produce but couldn't easily find it. We saw an opportunity 
            to use technology to solve this age-old problem.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            What started as a small project to connect a few local farmers with their community has grown into 
            a comprehensive platform that serves hundreds of farmers and thousands of customers across multiple regions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Today, we're proud to be part of the movement towards more sustainable, community-focused food systems, 
            and we're excited to continue growing and serving more communities in the future.
